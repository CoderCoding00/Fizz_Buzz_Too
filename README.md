# Fizz Buzz Too Instructions  
```md 
Given an int n, print the number followed by "!".
So the int 6 prints "6!". Except if the number is
divisible by 3 use "Fizz" instead of the number,
and if the number is divisible by 5 use "Buzz",
and if divisible by both 3 and 5, use "FizzBuzz".
Do not put the quotes around your output. When you run the program the test will put quotes around the output.

• input of 1 → "1!"
• input of 2 → "2!"
• input of 3 → "Fizz!"
```
